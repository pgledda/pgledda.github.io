                           <h1>Dripping down the rivulet: pattern formation of a thin film flowing under an inclined planar substrate</h1>
                           <p>
Ancient Greek philosophers, most notably Aristotle, engaged in profound contemplation regarding the intrinsic qualities of falling water. Aristotle's conceptualization of the terrestrial sphere encompassed four fundamental elements — earth, air, fire, and water — each subject to the inexorable forces of change and decay. Water exhibited a natural tendency to fall. In the realm of literature, whether portrayed as a gentle rain, as eloquently depicted in G. D'Annunzio's poem "La Pioggia nel Pineto", or as a solitary droplet, these literary depictionsevolved into metaphors for the delicate and ephemeral nature of human emotions and experiences.  <br>
The foundation of our investigation lies within the theoretical framework of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability—a phenomenon characterized by the destabilization of a horizontal interface between a denser fluid and its lighter counterpart. In this scenario, the interface undergoes instability, leading to the intrusion of the heavier fluid into the lighter one. Our exploration centers on scenarios where the presence of an upper wall confines the denser fluid, forming a thin layer beneath the solid surface. The uncertain equilibrium governing this interface manifests as a balance between destabilizing hydrostatic pressure and stabilizing effects induced by surface tension. </p>

                           Conventionally, a horizontal substrate yields regular patterns, often in the form of hexagons or squares. However, our study introduce a deliberate tilt which imparts a gravitational force characterized by both wall-normal and tangential components, thereby disrupting the expected symmetry through drainage. This inclination emerges as a crucial factor in averting the phenomenon of dripping — an occurrence defined by significant deformation of the interface leading to the separation of fluid phases. The nuanced adjustment of the substrate angle proves instrumental in maintaining stability and mitigating potential adverse effects within the fluid dynamics under scrutiny.  <br>

                              In our experimental setup, we continously infuse fresh fluid into the thin film. This dynamic replenishment facilitates a detailed observation of the spatial evolution of patterns, ultimately leading to the attainment of stationary shapes. 
                    A very viscous Newtonian fluid is injected under an inclined glass plate, with a constant flow rate. We study the dynamics of the flat film to spanwise perturbations at the inlet.  Spanwise-periodic and streamwise-aligned structures, called rivulets, invade the domain, with a well-defined wavelength set by the linear dispersion relation of the flat film.

                              The fully non-linear evolution leads to a steady pattern characterized by rivulets. We develop a one-dimensional model that ensures the conservation of the flow rate in the cross-section. We deduce that the central lobe, of high thickness, is steady. We recover the central lobe shape via the pendulum equation, i.e. the rivulet profile is a pure equilibrium between surface tension and gravity. A secondary stability analysis on this rivulet profile with respect to streamwise perturbations reveals that the rivulets are progressively stabilized as the flow rate or the inclination angle decrease, and only very large wavelengths remain weakly unstable. As a result of the instability, lenses traveling on the rivulets are observed.

We therefore numerically study the evolution of these lens perturbations on the spatially developing rivulets, with inlet and outlet conditions analogous to the experimental setup of Fig. 1. The inlet is also temporally forced the inlet with a harmonic forcing of frequency ω. The linear response to this harmonic forcing shows that wavy perturbation evolves in lenses and perturbations are damped on the sides. We identify an optimal frequency that maximizes the amplitude of the response, which is in good agreement with a weakly non-parallel stability analysis (WKBJ) and with the non-linear simulations.  We then focus on the late-stage of the growth of lenses on a fully-saturated rivulet and obtain an estimate of the dripping threshold as a function of k for this configuration. We finally combine the linear prediction and the non-linear one for fully-saturated rivulet and obtain an estimate of the dripping length in a large range of parameters, with a good agreement with the non-linear simulations.

                           <p>
In this analysis, we identified a possible route to dripping and a wide range of parameters for which rivulets are streamwise-saturated and steady. In the whole scenario of dripping of an overhanging liquid, these results suggest that a thin film would not immediately go from a flat state to a dripping state, but rather go by an intermediate state, i.e. rivulets that are exactly two-dimensional pendent drops. The dripping is linked to the secondary instability of the rivulet itself, more than to the stability of the flat film. We identified the ordered pattern of lenses, their amplification and we gave an estimate of the dripping length.

                           <h1>Flow instabilities past permeable bluff bodies</h1>
                           <p>A classical and pertinent subject within fluid mechanics is the interaction between fluid flows and bluff bodies. Serving as a timeless illustration of the captivating connection between the realms of science and art, this subject was protrayed by the Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci. Through his detailed observations and sketches, da Vinci demonstrated an early understanding of fluid dynamics and vortex formation in diverse hydraulic situations. His portrayal of this theme underscores the enduring fascination with natural patterns, highlighting the harmonious intersection of scientific inquiry and artistic expression. The von Kármán vortex street, named after the Hungarian-American physicist Theodore von Kármán, is a phenomen characterized by the formation of alternating vortices that trail behind the object invested by a stream. These vortices are known to create alternate loads on slender objects, eventually leading to catastrophic events.
Nature consistently offers inspiring models when it comes to shaping objects so as to serve practical purposes. Deep-sea glass (E. aspergillum) are tall, holed, cylindrical shells anchored to the seabed that extend through the benthic boundary layer. These sponges provide a natural shelter for a family of shrimps which feed themselves through the nutrients in suspension thanks to the internal recirculation patterns at low flow velocity of such permeable structures [1]. Dandelion seeds are transported by the wind attached to a hairy umbrella structure, called pappus, which helps the seed to travel for large distances [2]. These examples show how permeable structures offer an efficient way to maximize, without the need for active control systems, the hydrodynamic performance and eventually stabilize unsteady patterns. In the video below, we show the wake developing past an array of wires in a water channel, visualized through hydrogen bubbles.

                           <p>As initial benchmark aimed at unveiling the formation of vortex streets around slender permeable bodies at low Reynolds numbers, we examine a permeable cylinders of various sections subjected to a uniform flow. The porous body's internal flow follows a Darcy-Brinkman model, while the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations govern the external flow. In the case of steady flow past these objects, a detached recirculation bubble emerges, progressing downstream, diminishing in size and eventually disappearing with increasing permeability. Nevertheless, a velocity defect persists past the object for greater downstream distances when compared to the impervious scenario. The modifications of the wake in the onset of unsteady flow are studied through a linear stability analysis approach. The increase of permeability in slender cylinders results in a sudden increase in the critical Reynolds number for the onset of the von Karman vortex street. Beyond a critical value, the onset of the unsteady wake is suppressed. Similarly, the unsteady 2D wake structure is explored in the unsteady regime, revealing that alternate vortices endure at considerably larger distances, in contrast to the impervious case. The threshold for the onset of the three-dimensional instability in such unsteady periodic flow is also identified using a Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-based stability algorithm.

                           <p>Once the flow picture past slender permeable objects is established, we tailor the structure of our porous body to optimize hydrodynamic performance. To achieve this, we propose a formal framework for characterizing and optimizing the flow around permeable membranes through homogenization. This framework is applied to the two-dimensional wake flow past a permeable cylindrical shell. Homogenization establishes a connection between permeable filtration laws and the full-scale structure. An effective stress jump condition is employed to model the presence of the membrane, with normal and tangential velocities at the membrane proportional to the permeability and slip coefficient, respectively. A procedure for obtaining the microscopic geometry is implemented and validated for uniform distributions of permeability and slip over the membrane. Variations in filtrability and slip along the membrane are then considered, and their distributions are optimized to meet a specified objective using adjoint-based optimization. The optimal distributions are subsequently linked back to the microscopic geometry through a homogenization-based inverse procedure.
