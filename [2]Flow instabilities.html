                     <h1>Flow instabilities past permeable bluff bodies</h1>
                     <p>A classical and pertinent subject within fluid mechanics is the interaction between fluid flows and bluff bodies. Serving as a timeless illustration of the captivating connection between the realms of science and art, this subject was protrayed by the Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci. Through his detailed observations and sketches, da Vinci demonstrated an early understanding of fluid dynamics and vortex formation in diverse hydraulic situations. His portrayal of this theme underscores the enduring fascination with natural patterns, highlighting the harmonious intersection of scientific inquiry and artistic expression. The von K치rm치n vortex street, named after the Hungarian-American physicist Theodore von K치rm치n, is a phenomen characterized by the formation of alternating vortices that trail behind the object invested by a stream. These vortices are known to create alternate loads on slender objects, eventually leading to catastrophic events.
Nature consistently offers inspiring models when it comes to shaping objects so as to serve practical purposes. Deep-sea glass (E. aspergillum) are tall, holed, cylindrical shells anchored to the seabed that extend through the benthic boundary layer. These sponges provide a natural shelter for a family of shrimps which feed themselves through the nutrients in suspension thanks to the internal recirculation patterns at low flow velocity of such permeable structures [1]. Dandelion seeds are transported by the wind attached to a hairy umbrella structure, called pappus, which helps the seed to travel for large distances [2]. These examples show how permeable structures offer an efficient way to maximize, without the need for active control systems, the hydrodynamic performance and eventually stabilize unsteady patterns. In the video below, we show the wake developing past an array of wires in a water channel, visualized through hydrogen bubbles.

                     <p>As initial benchmark aimed at unveiling the formation of vortex streets around slender permeable bodies at low Reynolds numbers, we examine a permeable cylinders of various sections subjected to a uniform flow. The porous body's internal flow follows a Darcy-Brinkman model, while the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations govern the external flow. In the case of steady flow past these objects, a detached recirculation bubble emerges, progressing downstream, diminishing in size and eventually disappearing with increasing permeability. Nevertheless, a velocity defect persists past the object for greater downstream distances when compared to the impervious scenario. The modifications of the wake in the onset of unsteady flow are studied through a linear stability analysis approach. The increase of permeability in slender cylinders results in a sudden increase in the critical Reynolds number for the onset of the von Karman vortex street. Beyond a critical value, the onset of the unsteady wake is suppressed. Similarly, the unsteady 2D wake structure is explored in the unsteady regime, revealing that alternate vortices endure at considerably larger distances, in contrast to the impervious case. The threshold for the onset of the three-dimensional instability in such unsteady periodic flow is also identified using a Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-based stability algorithm.

                     <p>Once the flow picture past slender permeable objects is established, we tailor the structure of our porous body to optimize hydrodynamic performance. To achieve this, we propose a formal framework for characterizing and optimizing the flow around permeable membranes through homogenization. This framework is applied to the two-dimensional wake flow past a permeable cylindrical shell. Homogenization establishes a connection between permeable filtration laws and the full-scale structure. An effective stress jump condition is employed to model the presence of the membrane, with normal and tangential velocities at the membrane proportional to the permeability and slip coefficient, respectively. A procedure for obtaining the microscopic geometry is implemented and validated for uniform distributions of permeability and slip over the membrane. Variations in filtrability and slip along the membrane are then considered, and their distributions are optimized to meet a specified objective using adjoint-based optimization. The optimal distributions are subsequently linked back to the microscopic geometry through a homogenization-based inverse procedure.

                     <p>Similar increases in instability thresholds are observed for fixed disks and spheres, although, counter-intuitively, the sphere exhibits a range of permeability where the critical Reynolds number decreases. The analysis is enriched with the study of wake and path stability in the fluid-solid coupled problem for a permeable falling disk. Predicting the trajectories of falling or rising objects in viscous fluid is a significant problem in fluid dynamics. Falling disks, extensively studied for their diverse trajectories, ranging from zig-zag to tumbling and chaotic motions, lack similar investigations when the object is permeable. A linear stability analysis of the steady vertical path of a thin microstructured, permeable disk, modeled via a stress-jump model from homogenization theory, is conducted. The flow associated with the steady vertical path features a detached recirculation region from the disk, diminishing and disappearing as the disk becomes more permeable. Similar to the impervious disk, one non-oscillatory and several oscillatory unstable modes are identified. Permeability significantly alters the destabilization scenario. For sufficiently large permeabilities, the primary bifurcation at low disk inertia is nonoscillatory, resulting in a steady tilting of the disk. Further increases in permeability reduce the unstable regions in the parameter space until all linear instabilities are dampened. These findings could pave the way for a rational design of permeable structures to exploit aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flows, as well as the trajectories of falling objects.
